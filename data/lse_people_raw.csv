LSE London, Member - LSE London is the London School of Economics' specialist research unit focusing on analyses of London's economy and broader metropolitan issues in a comparative context. The unit has a strong international reputation particularly in the fields of labour markets, social and demographic change, housing, finance and governance, and is the leading academic centre for analyses of city-wide developments in London. It is an interdisciplinary group involving staff from a number of departments who have particular expertise in economics, geography, government and planning.
Conservation Policy:  Urban conservation policy is a strong theme in my current research.  Along with a colleague at the LSE, I have completed a large-scale analysis of conservation areas in England.  This has included a spatial hedonic analysis of more than 1million property transactions in 8,000 conservation areas in England and a qualitative analysis of more than 48 conservation areas in London.  Our preliminary findings suggest that positive heritage externalities exist and that residents in CAs tend to value their local environments, acknowledge the need for planning control and execute their right to object to neighbour’s planning request. A series of publications have and are following on from this research.  In addition, with colleagues at LSE London, I have applied for a large Urban Europe grant to examine how the value of heritage can be maintained in challenging economic conditions.
Urban Housing and Planning in London: My work here has dealt with the manner in which urban regime theory might help us understand politics and planning in the UK context.  I have recently undertaken research looking at the Localism Act using social capital to examine what the key dilemmas may be for localist planning. I have also completed work on the politics of suburbia in London and have examined housing density policy in the Capital.  Alongside colleagues in LSE London I have recently received £99,110 from the Higher Education Innovation Funding initiative to help us disseminate and exchange knowledge around our research on the Housing crisis in London.

Gareth’s research involves four principal projects. First, funded by a British Academy award on the ‘Infrastructure and Well-Being’ programme, Gareth is PI for the project ‘Engineering food: infrastructure exclusion and ‘last mile’ delivery in Brazilian favelas’. This research, with Dr Mara Nogueira (Birkbeck), Dr Aiko Ikemura Amaral (KCL), and in collaboration with Insper, looks at how food is made available in favela and occupations in Belo Horizonte and São Paulo, Brazil. With fieldwork conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the research has used the notion of ‘social infrastructure’ to look at how neighbourhoods and civil society responded to make food accessible, and how households relate to food practices, nutrition, and memory. A film from the research has been produced. 
Second, research that examines the intersection of cities, youth and violence. Through the 2000s, Gareth conducted ethnography with a group of ‘street youth’ in Mexico, noting how they related to civil society, security agencies and the wider state. This work included understanding the role of gangs, the drug economy and violence, and motivated the volume Youth Violence in Latin America: Gangs and juvenile justice in perspective (edited with D. Rodgers, Macmillan-Palgrave). He is presently involved with a five-year European Research Council project entitled Gangs, Gangsters, and Ganglands: Towards a Global Comparative Ethnography, for which he serves on the International Advisory Panel and is undertaking ethnographic fieldwork in Mexico.
Third, he has been Co Principal Investigator on an ESRC-NWO-DFG grant, with Professors Rivke Jaffe (Amsterdam) and Eveline Dürr (LMU), investigating the commodification of urban poverty and violence in four cities in the Americas: Kingston, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro and New Orleans. The research has looked at how inequality, represented through violence and poverty, has become a chic USP for certain communities and agents, sometimes incorporated into city branding, but often highly contested by residents and activists. Articles from the project have been published in Space & Culture and Urban Studies.
Fourth, research in South Africa considers how gated estates ‘do work’ to affirm class positions, ideas of whiteness, and associating exclusionary practices with ‘good governance’, the management of nature, and the symbolism of architecture and lifestyle. Research in Johannesburg follows how residents of a large township adjacent to a cluster of high-end estates gain skills and conduct labour, and how the estates organise and understand their social responsibilities to workers and neighbours. These projects are in collaboration with Richard Ballard at University of Witwatersrand.

Prior to this he worked in practice as a spatial planner in London alongside teaching planning at the University of Westminster. At LSE he delivers several of the core units for the Masters programme in Regional and Urban Planning Studies (RUPS) and teaches undergraduate courses in cultural geography with a focus on London.
His research interests focus on the interface between the conventions and institutions of planning and the priorities and perspectives of local communities. While many planning conventions may seek desirable outcomes, Alan is interested in the unintended consequences and/or the unspoken trade-offs, including of densification and green belt. He has framed green belt as a policy institution to understand why it produces such strong resistance to change in order to identify a route to reconstructing the policy with a new purpose that would lead to a reappraisal of its current extent. In relation to density, he is interested in how residents perceive higher density development and in the relationship between attitudes to housing need and the acceptability of densification. His research is also focused on the question of scale in planning governance, where he has employed empirical work in London and the Greater South East to draw out lessons on the challenges presented when seeking to resolve the differing aspirations and priorities of local and regional planners and politicians. 
Alan’s other broad research interest is in change in the suburbs. This includes research on how an increase in buy-to-let housing has led to suburban gentrification. And on how changes in the ethnic mix of residents across London’s suburbs is reflected in particular neighbourhood-based constructions of White ethnic identity. His interest in suburban change sometimes interfaces with his planning research, for example by focusing on the specific challenges of developing higher density housing in existing suburbs.","Urban Planning",NA,FALSE,"Associate Professor",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Her early work developed a critique of the NGO-ization of development, and subsequent work developed postcolonial approaches to civil society and diaspora. She is currently working on new research on peripheral urbanization in African cities. She has conducted research in Tanzania, Cameroon and the UK.
Claire’s research explores the significance of property to middle class reproduction in suburban Dar es Salaam. It examines how self-build housing on the urban periphery has become central to what it means to be middle class in contemporary Tanzania. In these new neighbourhoods, the acquisition of land and the construction of houses and suburban landscapes have become vehicles for the accumulation of material and aesthetic assets, creating new spaces of inequality at the urban periphery. The book based on this research, The suburban frontier: middle class construction in Dar es Salaam will be published as a monograph with University of California Press in Autumn 2024.
Claire’s current research further explores the relationship between self-build housing, urban change and urban economies in Africa. She is Principal Investigator on the ESRC-funded research project Home-Grown Growth in African Cities: How Self-Build Housing Drives Urban and Economic Growth in Ghana and Tanzania.

"academic-staff","Department of Geography and Environment","Dr Erica Pani","Assistant Professor (Education) of Local Economic Development and Planning ","Erica is Director of the MSc Local Economic Development. She graduated with a PhD in Economic Geography from Queen Mary, University of London in 2016. She joined the Department of Geography and Environment at the LSE in September 2019, after gaining experience at the LSE, Queen Mary University of London, and Newcastle University.
In her research, Erica adopts a heterodox approach to economic geography and urban planning. Her primary goal is to uncover and apply new theoretical, conceptual, and political frameworks that pave the way for equitable economic systems. By critically examining the dynamic interplay between economic practices and societal needs, Erica's work seeks to challenge and redefine traditional notions of value and economic structures. Her distinctive approach emphasizes the significance of recognizing diverse values and the impact they have on shaping our communities and environments. Through this lens, she explores the potential for creating more inclusive and socially just urban spaces.
Erica’s teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that education should be interactive and transformative. Her aim is to inspire students to think critically and reflectively, motivating them to question and expand their understandings of themselves and the world around them. With a focus on economic geography, research methods, local economic development, and planning, she employs a variety of engaging tools and activities to ensure a dynamic and enriching learning environment.
Research areas:
A Value Approach to Political Economy:Adapting and reposing Roger Lee’s work on the Ordinary Economy, Erica’s PhD explored how processes of neoliberalization necessarily emerge in-and-through existing multiple and complex socio-spatial relations. Focusing on the marketisation of Higher Education in England, her PhD won the Royal Geographic Society Best PhD in the UK Economic Geography Research Group, 2016.
A Value Approach to Planning:Collaborating with colleagues from the Regional and Urban Planning Studies Programme (RUPS) at the LSE, this work suggests that planning is entrenched in values and practices of value due to its fundamental role in planning for diverse material and social forms of society-economy.
Land Tenure Regularisation in Dar es Salaam:
This collaborative work with colleagues from RUPS and Economic Geography explores informal and formal institutions of land tenure security in Dar es Salaam. Every year, around 6 million people, world-wide, settle in slums. Thus, land tenure formalisation represents an increasingly urgent structural challenge to sustainable urban development and poverty reduction - particularly in developing contexts. As a rapidly growing city in Tanzania, Dar es Salaam presents an interesting and important case for exploring and theorising how embedded informal institutions affect structural change and inclusive economic growth in a Global South context.","Local Economic Development and Planning",NA,TRUE,"Assistant Professor",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE

Her work draws on and contributes to the study of the political ecology of development and agrarian change with a focus on South Asia and specifically Bangladesh, where she has worked and conducted research for over 15 years.
Kasia holds a PhD and MSc in Development Sociology from Cornell University and a bachelor’s degree from Hampshire College.
Kasia’s first book, Threatening Dystopias: The Global Politics of Climate Change Adaptation in Bangladesh (2021, Cornell University Press), investigates the politics of climate change adaptation in Bangladesh from multiple perspectives and scales, offering an in-depth analysis of the global politics of climate change adaptation and how they are both forged and manifested in this unique site. Frequently described as the ‘world’s most vulnerable country to climate change’, the oversimplified specter of a major country slipping underwater has yielded a crisis narrative that erases a complex history of landscape transformation and intense, contemporary political conflicts. Colonialism, capitalism, and local agrarian struggles have so far shaped the country’s coastline more than carbon emissions. Today, both national and global elites ignore this history, while crafting narratives and economic strategies that redistribute power and resources away from peasant communities in the name of climate adaptation.
The book draws on over two years of multi-sited ethnographic and archival fieldwork with development practitioners, policy makers, scientists, farmers and rural migrants, to investigate the politics of climate change adaptation in Bangladesh from multiple perspectives and scales, offering an in-depth analysis of the global politics of climate change adaptation and how they are both forged and manifested in this unique site.

She has a PhD in Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley, an MSc in Geography from LSE and a B.A in City and Regional Planning from the University of California, Berkeley.
Romola’s research focuses on the relationship between forced migration and urbanisation. In one strand of her research, she looks at how refugees and other forced migrants become ‘city makers’ through building and inhabiting urban spaces. This work had been conducted in India and Lebanon, through the study of Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut and Partition refugee colonies in Calcutta. Here, she explored how the act of building itself was a form of politics and how it challenged efforts by humanitarian organisations and host governments to marginalize and depoliticize refugees. She continues this work by studying how refugees come to inhabit and make homes whilst being displaced and living in legally precarious circumstances.
A second strand of this work looks at the geopolitics of humanitarian knowledge production, particularly on urban refugees. Titled Urban Humanitarianism, this work looks at how humanitarian organizations come to learn from and intervene in urban areas through various experiments and what politics are involved in building and sharing that knowledge.
Romola is also involved in a third project on the sharing economy. Working together with Dr Nancy Holman, Dr Mara Ferreri and Ms Alessandra Mossa, this work looks at the effects of AirBnB on urban governance, informality and planning in cities in the Global North.

"academic-staff","Department of Geography and Environment","Dr Austin  Zeiderman","Associate Professor of Geography","Austin Zeiderman is Associate Professor in the Department of Geography and Environment at the London School of Economics. He is an interdisciplinary scholar who specializes in the social and political dimensions of urbanization and the environment in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a focus on Colombia. Austin holds a PhD in Anthropology from Stanford University as well as a Master of Environmental Science degree from Yale University and a BA in Economics from Colgate University.
Austin’s scholarship is engaged with current debates across geography, anthropology, sociology, politics, and history. He is also active in the regional and thematic fields of Latin American and Caribbean studies, urban studies, environmental studies, science and technology studies, security studies, and Black studies. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Colombia over nearly two decades, he seeks to advance debates from these diverse scholarly traditions while pushing them to engage with the major social and environmental challenges of the present.
Austin has recently completed his second monograph, Artery: Racial Ecologies on Colombia’s Magdalena River (Duke 2025), which uncovers the historical and contemporary role of the waterway in the expansion of colonial and racial capitalism in the Americas. In so doing, Artery expands the understanding of present and future environmental crises by showing how unsustainable relations between humans and the planet are underpinned by unequal relations in human society. The account foregrounds the plan to create a logistics corridor along the river through a series of hydromodification works. Examining this infrastructure megaproject reveals the centrality of racialization to contemporary ecological predicaments as well as the conditions of possibility for change. Watch the trailer for the book here.
Austin’s first book, Endangered City: The Politics of Risk and Security in Bogotá (Duke 2016), examines the political imperative to protect life against future threats by focusing an ethnographic lens on the governance of environmental hazards (landslides, floods, and earthquakes) in the self-built settlements of the urban periphery. Based on eighteen months of fieldwork, Endangered City argues that logics of security and risk increasingly define political life, especially for those at the urban margins. The book theorizes the global condition of “endangerment”—that is, forms of collectivity and entitlement predicated on degrees of vulnerability and victimhood.
Austin’s research has appeared in a range of scholarly and public outlets, such as Antipode, Public Culture, Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, American Ethnologist, openDemocracy, and the Guardian. He has received fellowships and awards from the Fulbright Program, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the Mellon Foundation. From 2012 to 2014, Austin coordinated the Urban Uncertainty project at LSE Cities, where he remains a Research Associate. Raised in Philadelphia, he has previously worked on urban and environmental issues in Baltimore and San Francisco.
