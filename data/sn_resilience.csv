While many studies have considered what factors might lead to tillage reduction, few have considered the role of social and structural determinants in farmer decision-making. Fewer still have considered tillage intensity as existing on a continuous spectrum that ranges from no-till to conventional tillage. Using primary data collected from Michigan soybean growers and an adapted Theory of Planned Behavior model, this article identifies key relationships between growers' demographics, social connections and their tillage practices. Results indicate that farmers with lower household income, more farming experience and weaker social network connectivity may be more likely to adopt CT technologies in Michigan soybean production. In addition to these factors, accounting for farmers’ subjective perspectives on the efficacy of CT, particularly its ability to save labor and conserve soil, may increase the success of future outreach encouraging CT in this context. These results have important implications for ongoing extension programs, as they suggest that adoption of sustainable agricultural practices such as CT is not only a function of individual level farm or farmer characteristics, but also of farmer perceptions of the opinions and practices of their unique social networks.","2022-01-01","2022-01-18 19:38:32","2022-01-18 19:38:32","2022-01-18 19:38:14","378-386","","","89","","Journal of Rural Studies","The relationship between farmer demographics, social identity and tillage behavior","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/ITPL7YLW/S0743016722000018.html","","","Conservation tillage; Social network analysis; Soybeans; Theory of planned behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here I present an operationable and simple framework with theoretical underpinning to assess to what extent agroecological transitions propend to greater resilience and adaptability. Ecosystems may transition between alternative states defined by their structural and functional characteristics. Agroecological transitions are a special type of human-mediated transitions in which the various components of the agroecosystem and their interactions are reconfigured through a process of design. The concept of the complex adaptive cycle of social-ecological systems is used to propose a set of 10 criteria to monitor resilience and adaptability in agroecological transitions using a system of scores. They comprise: self-regulation, connectivity, functional diversity and redundancy, response diversity, space and time heterogeneity, building of natural capital, social self-organization, reflective learning and human capital, autonomy and local interdependency, and capitalising on local knowledge. The framework is illustrated with an example from Brazil, where national and local level socio-political drivers have supported a 30-year process of agroecological transition. Implications for policy monitoring, research for development and political discourses are discussed.","2020-09-01","2021-12-17 14:45:33","2021-12-17 14:45:33","2020-12-09 16:19:32","102862","","","184","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/I3NM26H2/Tittonell - 2020 - Assessing resilience and adaptability in agroecolo.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/PSJAFYWK/S0308521X19310091.html","","","Agroecology; Complex adaptive cycle; Indicator framework; Land use change; State and transition models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, diversification enhances biodiversity, pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and water regulation without compromising crop yields. Practices targeting aboveground biodiversity boosted pest control and water regulation, while those targeting belowground biodiversity enhanced nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and water regulation. Most often, diversification practices resulted in win-win support of services and crop yields. Variability in responses and occurrence of trade-offs highlight the context dependency of outcomes. Widespread adoption of diversification practices shows promise to contribute to biodiversity conservation and food security from local to global scales.

Additionally, historically low winter snowfall preceding the summer of 2016 exacerbated drought conditions and led to record low streamflows in some regions. Climate models suggest that short-term summer droughts could increase in frequency and continue to pose challenges to farmers and water resource managers in the Northeast. Here we focus on the impacts of the drought on farmers in New York State (NY), an economically important agricultural state in the Northeast. We found that in several regions across NY 2015-16 winter snowfall, and 2016 growing season precipitation and streamflows were near or below the 10th percentile of the previous 60 years; and 2016 air temperatures were near or above the 90th percentile of the previous 60 years. Based on survey results, more than 70% of the 275 farmers surveyed across NY reported rainfed field crop and pasture yield losses greater than 30%, with some loses over 90%. In the hardest hit Western region of NY, substantial crop losses (>30%) were reported for fruit and vegetable crops on farms with irrigation, due to limited irrigation equipment and water supplies (e.g. low streamflows, dry ponds or wells). After what they experienced in 2016, 32% of the 75 farmers in follow-up interviews invested in irrigation equipment and water sources in 2016, and 32% said they plan to do so in 2017. Thirty-two percent of farmers in follow-up interviews said they plan to take measures to improve soil health and soil organic matter to improve water holding capacity and better prepare for drought. Model estimates suggest NY state-wide crop irrigation water use could increase by 3–8 times in dry years compared to average growing seasons, increasing seasonal usage by millions of cubic meters. This highlights the potential for significant increases in water withdrawals in NY, with implications for water resources, particularly as the climate changes.","2017-12-15","2021-12-17 14:42:55","2021-12-17 14:42:55","2018-01-23 19:33:32","571-581","","","247","","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/K26W3AUJ/Sweet et al. - 2017 - Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern Un.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/EQEQ87IB/S0168192317302800.html","","","Adaptation; Climate change; Drought; Irrigation; Water management; Yield loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technology-focused literature on socio-technical transitions shares some of the complex systems sensibilities of social-ecological systems research.

This paper examines a critically important aspect of this approach: the relationship between radically novel sociotechnical practices in niches and the mainstream social–technical regimes they seek to influence. Although the literature notes the significance of this relationship, it does so in a paradoxical way. It is argued that niches are more likely to influence mainstream change when they show a degree of compatibility with the incumbent regime. Yet this compatibility criterion blunts the scope for niches to be radically innovative, thereby undermining the degree of regime transformation being sought. The case of organic food is used to explore this paradox empirically. The history of the organic niche, and its engagement and entanglement with the mainstream food regime, suggests a dialectical relationship between sociotechnical niches and regimes.","2006-06-01","2021-12-17 14:41:39","2021-12-17 14:41:39","2018-09-21 17:55:06","439-458","","3","24","","Environ Plann C Gov Policy","Green Niches in Sustainable Development","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/WNN3YNI9/Smith - 2006 - Green Niches in Sustainable Development The Case .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No-till is a low disturbance farming practice with potential to benefit soil health, the aquatic environment and farm economy, but is currently only implemented at a small scale in Europe. Interpersonal networks are important for farmers and influence farmer learning and decision-making and farmers often view each other as their main source of information. In this study, the social networks of 16 no-till farmers in England were mapped and semi-structured interviews carried out to assess the link between farmer network characteristics and the implementation of no-till in England. We also aimed to improve our understanding of the nature and extent of knowledge exchanged within farmer networks and their spatial and temporal dynamics. Our findings suggest that intermediary farmers had an important role in increasing the information flow and knowledge exchange between the different clusters of the no-till farmer network. These intermediaries were also the biggest influencers as they were often no-till farmers with a high level of experiential knowledge and viewed as important sources of information by other farmers. No-till farmer networks were geographically distributed as the farmers preferred to discuss farming practices with similar minded no-till farmers rather than local conventional farmers who did not understand what they were trying to achieve. Therefore, online communication platforms like social media were important for communication. We question the role of formal extension services in supporting farmers with innovative practices like no-till and suggest that advisors should strive to improve their understanding of these well-developed information networks to enable a more streamlined and efficient information diffusion.","2020-05-01","2021-12-17 14:41:10","2021-12-17 14:41:10","2020-12-18 16:04:14","102824","","","181","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/3M8X7SY8/Skaalsveen et al. - 2020 - The role of farmers' social networks in the implem.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/YXQZ9D6H/S0308521X19306535.html","","","Farmer networks; Knowledge exchange; Learning; No-till; SNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Postulated benefits of diversity in experimental grasslands include greater and more stable primary production along with more efficient nutrient use. These benefits have been extrapolated to forage and grazing land systems with little supporting objective data. Most information on the potential benefits of increased plant diversity comes from studies of synthesized grasslands that have not included domestic grazing animals. We explore this debate relative to the management of temperate forage and grazing lands. Plant species diversity refers to the number of species (richness) and their relative abundance (evenness) within a defined area. Plant relations influence biodiversity responses through positive (e.g., facilitation, N^sub 2^ fixation, hydraulic lift) and negative interactions (e.g., competitive exclusion, allelopathy). Early 20th century research on complex mixtures of forage species (limited to grasses and legumes) for pasture indicated equivocal results regarding benefits of species-rich mixtures and typically recommended using the best adapted species in simple grass-legume mixtures. Recent research indicates potential herbage yield benefits from species-rich mixtures for pastures. Limited animal productivity research on species-rich mixtures indicates variable responses and much more research is needed. Grazing land productivity is a primary focus for biodiversity benefits because of the direct economic relevance to producers. However, taking a broader view of the multifunctionality of grazing lands to include environmental and aesthetic benefits to humans reveals a great scope for using biodiversity in grazing land management.

Rogers, professor and chair of the Department of Communication & Journalism at the University of New Mexico, explains how new ideas spread via communication channels over time. Such innovations are initially perceived as uncertain and even risky. To overcome this uncertainty, most people seek out others like themselves who have already adopted the new idea. Thus the diffusion process consists of a few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word among their circle of acquaintances—a process which typically takes months or years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the 1990s, for example, may have spread more rapidly than any other innovation in the history of humankind. Furthermore, the Internet is changing the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the importance of physical distance between people. The fifth edition addresses the spread of the Internet, and how it has transformed the way human beings communicate and adopt new ideas.","2003-08-16","2021-12-17 14:39:44","2021-12-17 14:39:44","","","576","","","","","","","","","","Free Press","New York","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Diffusion-Innovations-5th-Everett-Rogers/dp/0743222091","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5th edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the potential benefits of cropping systems diversity, few farmers in the US Corn Belt use diverse rotations. This study examines factors that may influence farmers' decisions to use more diversified crop rotations in the US Corn Belt through a parallel convergent mixed methods approach, using a multi-level analysis of Corn Belt farmer survey data (n = 4,778) and in-depth interviews (n = 159). Analyses were conducted to answer questions regarding what factors influence farmers' use of extended crop rotations in intensive corn-based cropping systems and to explore whether farmers in the Corn Belt might use extended crop rotations in response to climatic changes. Findings suggest that path dependency associated with the intensive corn-based cropping system in the region limits farmers' ability to integrate more diverse crop rotations. However, farmers in more diversified watersheds, those who farm marginal land, and those with livestock are more likely to use extended rotations. Additionally, farmers who currently use more diverse rotations are also more likely to plan to use crop rotations as a climate change adaptation strategy. If more diverse cropping systems are desired to reduce climate risks, in addition to reducing the negative impacts associated with industrial agricultural production, then further efforts must be made to facilitate more diverse crop rotations in the U.S. Corn Belt. This may be achieved by adjusting policy and economic incentives that presently discourage cropping system diversity in the region.","2018-01-01","2021-12-17 14:39:15","2021-12-17 14:39:15","","","206","","48","","","Barriers to implementing climate resilient agricultural strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","DOI: 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.12.002","","","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gabrielle_Roesch-Mcnally/publication/322071255_Barriers_to_implementing_climate_resilient_agricultural_strategies_The_case_of_crop_diversification_in_the_US_Corn_Belt/links/5a4297cda6fdcce19715b42c/Barriers-to-implementing-climate-resilient-agricultural-strategies-The-case-of-crop-diversification-in-the-US-Corn-Belt.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As organic dairy farming has grown, farmers have realised that many available conventional breeds of cow are not well adapted to the new situations and that more ‘robust’ cows, able to function well in the constraining organic environment, are needed to yield acceptable longevity and productivity. In this review paper, the current breed diversity in organic dairy farming is analysed with the aim of identifying the types of cow that would best fulfil organic breeding goals. Unlike the conventional sector, organic dairy farming is very heterogeneous and no single type of cow can adapt well to all scenarios. There are advantages and disadvantages to the use of existing breeds (rustic Holstein-Friesian, other rustic breeds and crosses), and strong genotype × environment interactions demand different strategies for very diverse situations. Organic dairy farms producing milk for systems that recompense milk volume would benefit from using higher milk yielding cows, and rustic Holstein-Friesian cows may be the best option in such cases. Although most Holstein-Friesian cows are currently selected for use in conventional systems, this situation could be reversed by the implementation of an organic merit index that includes organic breeding goals. Farms producing milk either for systems that recompense milk solids or for transformation into dairy products would benefit from using breeds other than Holstein-Friesian or their crosses. Organic farmers who focus on rural tourism, farm schools or other businesses in which marketing strategies must be taken into account could benefit from using local breeds (when possible) or other rustic breeds that are highly valued by consumers.","2019-02","2021-12-17 14:39:00","2021-12-17 14:39:00","2020-12-12 20:47:55","3-12","","1","86","","","Breeding for organic dairy farming","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/5FTR5JC8/Rodríguez-Bermúdez et al. - 2019 - Breeding for organic dairy farming what types of .pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/PF2MGU8S/D6DE8A4691204EA07B6A2F6D0631465F.html","","","crosses; dairy breeds; dairy cattle; Holstein-Friesian; organic farming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the largest challenges facing humanity is to secure the production of food and fiber while avoiding long-term negative impacts on ecosystems and the range of services that they provide. Resilience has been used as a framework for understanding sustainability challenges in a range of ecosystem types, but has not been systematically applied across the range of systems specifically used for the production of food and fiber in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. This paper applied a resilience lens to production ecosystems in which anthropogenic inputs play varying roles in determining system dynamics and outputs. We argue that the traditional resilience framework requires important additions when applied to production systems. We show how sustained anthropogenic inputs of external resources can lead to a ‘‘coercion’’ of resilience and describe how the global interconnectedness of many production systems can camouflage signals indicating resilience loss.","2014-06","2021-12-17 14:37:28","2021-12-17 14:37:28","2019-03-11 15:36:37","art73","","6","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/G79PNQEQ/Rist et al. - 2014 - Applying resilience thinking to production ecosyst.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study uses a vote count methodology and counts every instance of positive, negative and insignificant relationships in 55 studies. Education levels, capital, income, farm size, access to information, positive environmental attitudes, environmental awareness, and utilization of social networks emerge as some of the variables that are more often positively, rather than negatively, associated with adoption rates. The type of statistical analysis used in the studies has a negligible effect on the results. When different types of BMPs are examined in similar groupings, the aggregated findings generally hold true. The study concludes that farmer adoption rates can be improved by focusing on the generally consistent determinants of agricultural BMP adoption.

This review finds that, taken as a whole, few independent variables have a consistent statistically significant relationship with adoption. Analyses showed that variables positively associated with adoption include the farmer self-identifying primarily as stewardship motivated or otherwise nonfinancially motivated, environmental attitudes, a positive attitude toward the particular program or practice, previous adoption of other conservation practices, seeking and using information, awareness of programs or practices, vulnerable land, greater farm size, higher levels of income and formal education, engaging in marketing arrangements, and positive yield impact expected. Some variables often thought to be important, such as land tenure, did not emerge as consistently important in this cross-study review. Other variables, such as farmers' sense of place, training, presence of institutional conditions supporting adoption, and the role of collective decision making are not measured in enough studies to draw conclusions but potentially have a relationship with adoption decisions. Implications for how to promote conservation adoption and directions for future research are discussed. Because positive attitudes and awareness of conservation programs or practices are positive predictors of adoption, practitioners should share benefits of specific practices and programs and leverage existing practice adoption. Further work to explore relationships between conservation adoption and the role of farmer identity, nuances of land tenure, and the influence of structural factors is needed. Moreover, we suggest that future research should focus on the impact of different messages and avenues of reaching farmers in order to continue to inform conservation practices. Future research should consider both individual and institutional factors that facilitate and constrain adoption.","2019-09-01","2021-12-17 14:34:56","2021-12-17 14:34:56","2020-12-06 22:13:20","520-534","","5","74","","","Adoption of agricultural conservation practices in the United States","","","","","","","en","© 2019 by the Soil and Water Conservation Society","","","","www.jswconline.org","","Publisher: Soil and Water Conservation Society Section: Research Section","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/7FKEBSHM/Prokopy et al. - 2019 - Adoption of agricultural conservation practices in.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/4CJBQWRC/520.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maintaining productive systems under resource scarcity and multiplicative stresses requires precise monitoring and systems-scale planning. By incorporating ecological resilience into agroecosystems research we can gain valuable insight into agroecosystem identity, change, responsivity, and performance under stress, but only if we move away from resilience as a mere touchstone concept. Using the productivity, stability, resistance, and recovery of system processes as a basic framework for resilience monitoring, we propose quantitative research approaches to tackle the continuing lack of biophysical, field-scale indicators needed to lend insight into dynamic resilience variables and mechanisms. We emphasize the importance of considering productive functions, sources of system regulation and disturbance, and cross-scale interactions when applying resilience theory to agroecosystems. Agroecosystem resilience research requires understanding of multiple scales and speeds of influence both above and below the focal scale. When these considerations are addressed, resilience theory can add tangible value to agroecosystems research, both for the purposes of monitoring current systems and of planning future systems that can reconcile productivity and sustainability goals.","2018-05-01","2021-12-17 14:34:31","2021-12-17 14:34:31","2018-09-05 12:47:05","19-27","","","162","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/2ZBTWKIT/Peterson et al. - 2018 - Ways forward for resilience research in agroecosys.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/TMUVJTRX/S0308521X17300860.html","","","Agriculture; Crop yield; Ecophysiology; Ecosystem services; Social-ecological systems; Stress tolerance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resilience has three defining characteristics: the amount of change the system can undergo while maintaining its functions and structures, the degree of self-organization, and the capacity for learning and adaptation. To assess the resilience of a farming system, various elements that can build resilience are identified. Using these elements, the paper assesses organic agriculture using the IFOAM Basic Standard. The analysis shows that organic farming has a number of promising characteristics building resilience. However, when analyzing the current development of organic farming practice in light of the effects of government regulation and market dynamics, there is a danger that this quality is lost. Therefore, conversion alone may not be enough to ensure farm resilience. The ability of organic farming to realize its resilience building potential will depend on the ability of the organic movement to adapt and learn from the current experiences.","2003-07-17","2021-12-17 14:30:48","2021-12-17 14:30:48","2018-09-20 14:26:33","81-97","","3","22","","","Building Farm Resilience","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/G8JT39V5/Milestad and Darnhofer - 2003 - Building Farm Resilience The Prospects and Challe.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/79JU6ZYC/J064v22n03_09.html","","","organic farming; IFOAM; market pressures; regulation; resilience; socio-ecological systems; standards; Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, even though the components of the agrifood systems are all strongly interconnected, the design processes to improve their sustainabilities are still mostly managed separately. This frequently leads to innovating in one domain in order to adapt to the constraints or specifications of the other, such as tweaking the farming systems to address processing issues, or the other way round. The objectives of this paper are first to show the limits of such an organization, and second to provide a heuristic framework to organize the design of coupled innovations, by reconnecting the dynamics of innovation in agriculture and food, with a view to improving the whole agrifood system. Our framework highlights that working at this level requires designing in raw production, exchange, processing, and consumption, while taking into account synergies or antagonisms between upstream and downstream. Thus, the innovations are not only technological – e.g. concerning cropping systems or processing – but also organizational and institutional. Based on several examples, in the cereal, linseed, legume, and market-gardening productions, at the junction of agriculture and food sciences, we also show that this perspective of designing coupled innovations calls for a renewed research agenda. Three main domains are thus questioned. First, coupling requires an innovative design process for radical innovations, challenging the coordination of exploration in both domains. Second, the development of “innovation niches” outside the dominant sociotechnical regime, in order to bypass the lock-in from the dominant system, faces the difficulty of favoring the building of renewed networks of actors, which were used to working separately so far. Third, the necessity to share expectations and knowledge, and to design together innovations that suit all sides, leads to making several recommendations for the governance of the design process. Finally, we conclude that the need for innovation in the agrifood systems requires going beyond the historical specialization of skills, and the usual forms of coordination between designers.","2017-10-01","2021-12-17 14:30:25","2021-12-17 14:30:25","2019-02-28 15:06:11","330-339","","","157","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/9ES2UP4B/Meynard et al. - 2017 - Designing coupled innovations for the sustainabili.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/95GY7AJA/S0308521X1630378X.html","","","Agroecology; Food system; Innovative design; Lock-in; Open innovation; Value chain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technological lock-in has resulted from the coevolution of crop systems (based on the post-WWII agrochemical paradigm), public policies, and market dynamics that promote major crops such as cereals. This chapter explains how interrelated factors have favored increasing returns to adoption for cereals to the detriment of minor crops. The evolutionary economics approach used here identifies the main economic mechanisms that reinforce the choice of an initial production pathway.

Because of its focus on direct producer-consumer relations, the relocalisation perspective suggests a possible transition pathway, but does not fully address the diversity of interdependencies in agrifood systems (food being largely processed, distributed and provided by intermediaries) and therefore fails to effectively reconnect agriculture and food issues. This article shows the need to consider the possible reconnections between agricultural, food and environmental issues from a perspective that takes this diversity in agrifood systems into account. Such a perspective would go beyond the prevailing paradigm of relocalisation. Based on the analysis of recent scientific and public debates and on case studies carried out in France and Brazil, the article suggests a territorial agrifood systems perspective that takes account of the diverse actors and institutions involved in agriculture and food, and the diverse relations between agriculture, food and the environment that can contribute to the development of alternative and more resilient pathways.","2015","2021-12-17 14:21:46","2021-12-17 14:21:46","2019-02-25 13:32:03","41-61","","1","55","","","Sustainability and Resilience in Agrifood Systems","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Author.

Here we report on (1) forage yield ranges of cereal rye and triticale in corn-cereal rotations in New York in 2012-2014, and (2) survey results of 30 New York farm managers who grew winter cereals as double crops with corn silage in 2013. Yields averaged 3.62 and 4.88 Mg ha-1 for cereal rye and triticale, respectively. On average, the surveyed farmers planted 8% of their tillable acres to winter cereal with the intent to harvest as forage. Triticale was the most frequently seeded double crop (70%). Most stands were established with a drill (57%). Manure was applied to 37% of the fields. Fertilizer nitrogen (N) was applied at dormancy break by 79% of the farmers with a median application rate of 67 kg N ha-1. The biggest challenge with the double-crop rotation, identified by the farmers, was timely seeding of the double crop in the fall given late corn silage harvest and early onset of frost in the Northeast. Despite challenges encountered and questions about the impact of harvest of the winter cereal on the main crop, 83% of the surveyed farmers planned to continue to grow double crops.","2015-01-15","2021-12-17 14:21:21","2021-12-17 14:21:21","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/L5GZDNGE/276235624_Winter_Cereals_as_Double_Crops_in_Corn_Rotations_on_New_York_Dairy_Farms.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These include the need to increase production of nutrient-dense food, to improve agriculture's effects on soil, water, wildlife, and climate, and to enhance equity and justice in food and agricultural systems. We argue that certain politics of constructive collective action—and integral involvement of agricultural scientists in these politics—is essential for meeting grand challenges and other complex problems facing agriculture in the 21st century. To spur reflection and deliberation about the role of politics in the work of agricultural scientists, we outline these politics of constructive collective action. These serve to organize forceful responses to grand challenges through coordinated and cooperative action taken by multiple sectors of society. In essence, these politics entail (1) building bonds of affinity within a heterogenous network, (2) developing a shared roadmap for collective action, and (3) taking sustained action together. These emerging politics differ markedly from more commonly discussed forms of political activity by scientists, e.g., policy advisory, policy advocacy, and protest. We present key premises for our thesis, and then describe and discuss a politics of constructive collective action, the necessary roles of agricultural scientists, and an agenda for exploring and expanding their engagement in these politics. Meeting agricultureâ€™s grand challenges requires coordinated technical and social innovation Coordinated innovation requires broad, sustained collective action Such efforts can be organized by a new politics of constructive collective action Agricultural scientists must participate actively in these new politics Agricultural scientists can become skilled actors in constructive politics of collective action This article is protected by copyright.

Together they form a panarchy. The panarchy describes how a healthy system can invent and experiment, benefiting from inventions that create opportunity while being kept safe from those that destabilize because of their nature or excessive exuberance. Each level is allowed to operate at its own pace, protected from above by slower, larger levels but invigorated from below by faster, smaller cycles of innovation. The whole panarchy is therefore both creative and conserving. The interactions between cycles in a panarchy combine learning with continuity. An analysis of this process helps to clarify the meaning of “sustainable development.” Sustainability is the capacity to create, test, and maintain adaptive capability. Development is the process of creating, testing, and maintaining opportunity. The phrase that combines the two, “sustainable development,” thus refers to the goal of fostering adaptive capabilities and creating opportunities.

Howard, born and educated in England, directed agricultural research centers in India (1905–1931) before permanently returning to England. His years of agricultural research experiences and observations gradually evolved into a philosophy and concept of organic farming that he espoused in several books. Howard's thinking on soil fertility and the need to effectively recycle waste materials, including sewage sludge, onto farmland was reinforced by F.H. King's book, Farmers of Forty Centuries. Howard developed a system of composting that became widely adopted. Howard's concept of soil fertility centered on building soil humus with an emphasis on how soil life was connected to the health of crops, livestock, and mankind. Howard argued that crop and animal health was a birthright and that the correct method of dealing with a pathogen was not to destroy the pathogen but to see what could be learned from it or to ‘make use of it for tuning up agricultural practice’. The system of agriculture advocated by Howard was coined ‘organic’ by Walter Northbourne to refer to a system ‘having a complex but necessary interrelationship of parts, similar to that in living things’. Lady Eve Balfour compared organic and non-organic farming and helped to popularize organic farming with the publication of The Living Soil. Jerome Rodale, a publisher and an early convert to organic farming, was instrumental in the diffusion and popularization of organic concepts in the US. Both Howard and Rodale saw organic and non-organic agriculture as a conflict between two different visions of what agriculture should become as they engaged in a war of words with the agricultural establishment. A productive dialogue failed to occur between the organic community and traditional agricultural scientists for several decades. Organic agriculture gained significant recognition and attention in 1980, marked by the USDA publication Report and Recommendations on Organic Farming. The passage of the Federal Organic Foods Production Act in 1990 began the era of accommodation for organic farming in the USA, followed by another milestone with official labeling as USDA Certified Organic in 2002. Organic agriculture will likely continue to evolve in response to ongoing social, environmental, and philosophical concerns of the organic movement.","2006-09","2021-12-17 14:07:52","2021-12-17 14:07:52","2020-12-12 17:28:57","143-150","","3","21","","","A history of organic farming","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/26ZJD28J/C2A1F5AFE4D21398E3174D7650CEE521.html; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/4U4ZYJK3/Heckman - 2006 - A history of organic farming Transitions from Sir.pdf","","","Albrect Daniel Thaer; Carl Sprengel; E.B.

Data were not available from all farmers in all years; on average, the sample analyzed contained 11 MIG farms and 26 confinement farms. Management-intensive grazing operators were more profitable on a per hundredweight, per cow, and per acre basis, and no less profitable on a whole-farm basis. Even though the confinement operators had higher gross income than MIG operators, their expenses exceeded those of MIG operators. Profits of MIG operations were less variable as well, so that MIG operators faced less income risk. Increased reliance on grazing has other benefits as well. Grazing seems to be a much healthier practice for dairy cows. Veterinary, breeding, and medicine costs per cow are much less for cows that are pastured than those raised in confinement systems. Because they are healthier, cows that are grazed can be milked longer (or culled less frequently). As a result, MIG operators have a larger number of higher quality animals for sale (e.g., bred heifers). Management-intensive operations are also less labor intensive. Reductions in crop production and in the time cows spend in the barn led to significant reductions in field work and cleaning operations in the barn. Costs of hired labor were thus substantially lower in MIG operations than in confinement operations. Land requirements likely impose the principal limitation on the size of intensive grazing operations. In the mid-Atlantic, for instance, grazing operations need 1.5 to 2.0 acres of pasture for every dairy cow/calf equivalent to provide sufficient grass to support a dairy operation. Pasture land for MIG operators must be contiguous to the milking parlor and located no farther than a cow can walk to and from twice a day. That requirement likely limits the maximum size of an intensive grazing operation, especially in areas where land prices and rents are high, as they are in much of the mid-Atlantic.","2013-03-01","2021-12-17 14:07:35","2021-12-17 14:07:35","2018-09-10 13:55:14","1894-1904","","3","96","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/IKYMLRCT/S0022030213000209.html","","","management-intensive grazing; mid-Atlantic region; profitability; risk analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Complexity theory was developed from key ideas in economics, physics, biology, and the social sciences and contributes to important new concepts for approaching issues of environmental sustainability such as resilience, scaling, and networks.Complexity Theory for a Sustainable Future is a hands-on treatment of this exciting new body of work and its applications, bridging the gap between theoretical and applied perspectives in the management of complex adaptive systems. Focusing primarily on natural resource management and community-based conservation, the book features contributions by leading scholars in the field, many of whom are among the leaders of the Resilience Alliance. Theoreticians will find a valuable synthesis of new ideas on resilience, sustainability, asymmetries, information processing, scaling, and networks. Managers and policymakers will benefit from the application of these ideas to practical approaches and empirical studies linked to social-ecological systems. Chapters present new twists on such existing approaches as scenario planning, scaling analyses, and adaptive management, and the book concludes with recommendations on how to manage natural resources, how to involve stakeholders in the dynamics of a system, and how to explain the difficult topic of scale. A vital reference for an emerging discipline, this volume provides a clearer understanding of the conditions required for systems self-organization, since the capacity of any system to self-organize is crucial for its sustainability over time.","2008-07-11","2021-12-17 14:06:50","2021-12-17 14:06:50","","119-147","","","","","","","","","","","Columbia University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: RBBOarefKC8C","","","","","Science / Environmental Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In total, data on 33 788 lactations between January 2003 and February 2009 from 15 015 cows were available. Holstein–Friesian pure-bred cows produced most kg of milk in 305 days, but with the lowest percentages of fat and protein of all pure-bred cows in the data set. Cross-breeding Holstein dairy cows with other breeds (Brown Swiss, Dutch Friesian, Groningen White Headed, Jersey, Meuse Rhine Yssel, Montbéliarde or Fleckvieh) decreased milk production, but improved fertility and udder health in most cross-bred animals. In most breeds, heterosis had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on milk (kg in 305 days), fat and protein-corrected milk production (kg in 305 days) and calving interval (CI) in the favourable direction (i.e. more milk, shorter CI), but unfavourably for somatic cell count (higher cell count). Recombination was unfavourable for the milk production traits, but favourable for the functional traits (fertility and udder health). Farm characteristics, like soil type or housing system, affected the regression coefficients on breed components significantly. The effect of the Holstein breed on milk yield was twice as large in cubicle housing as in other housing systems. Jerseys had a negative effect on fertility only on farms on sandy soils. Hence, breed effects differ across farming systems in the organic farming and farmers can use such information to dovetail their farming system with the type of cow they use.","2013-04","2021-12-17 14:06:26","2021-12-17 14:06:26","2020-12-12 20:52:00","655-665","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/GAACT5C9/CB2C1830E0685778DEA0F979BBF76D50.html; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/P5DTDKAG/Haas et al. - 2013 - Suitability of cross-bred cows for organic farms b.pdf","","","organic farming; breed–environment interaction; cross-breeding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent trends in organic dairy raise questions about whether organic dairy is conventionalizing, which is to say it is coming to resemble the conventional sector as shown in disparities of power in the value chain that pressure all participants to adopt more industrial practices. This paper reports the results of an exploratory qualitative study of whether and how the organic milk value chain in upstate New York is conventionalizing. Findings lend some support to the conventionalization hypothesis in that organic milk from the beginning has been produced, processed, and marketed as a commodity, and the federal regulations governing organic dairy have facilitated the replication of this commodity-based system. However, there is also evidence that some producers are responding to these pressures not by intensifying, but by going deeper into the alternative organic model, forging more direct and local relationships along the value chain and embracing principles of the organic movement.","2009-03-01","2021-12-17 14:06:09","2021-12-17 14:06:09","2018-09-03 11:56:57","29-42","","1","26","","Agric Hum Values","Exploring the conventionalization of organic dairy","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/576APNI8/Guptill - 2009 - Exploring the conventionalization of organic dairy.pdf","","","Commodity systems; Conventionalization; Organic dairy; Value chains","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ecological, economic, and social elements all play a role, but despite ongoing efforts, researchers have yet to succeed in integrating the various disciplines in a way that gives adequate representation to the insights of each.Panarchy, a term devised to describe evolving hierarchical systems with multiple interrelated elements, offers an important new framework for understanding and resolving this dilemma. Panarchy is the structure in which systems, including those of nature (e.g., forests) and of humans (e.g., capitalism), as well as combined human-natural systems (e.g., institutions that govern natural resource use), are interlinked in continual adaptive cycles of growth, accumulation, restructuring, and renewal. By understanding these cycles and their scales, researchers can identify the points at which a system is capable of accepting positive change, and can use those points to foster resilience within the system.This volume brings together leading thinkers on the subject to develop and examine the concept of panarchy and to consider how it can be applied to human, natural, and human-natural systems. Throughout, contributors seek to identify adaptive approaches to management that recognize uncertainty and encourage innovation while fostering resilience.The book is a fundamental new development in a widely acclaimed line of inquiry.

This article makes four contributions to the approach by addressing some open issues. The first contribution is to explicitly incorporate the user side in the analysis. Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor’s perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies. The perspective is particularly useful to analyse long-term dynamics, shifts from one socio-technical system to another and the co-evolution of technology and society.","2004-09-01","2021-12-17 14:05:30","2021-12-17 14:05:30","2018-10-14 00:52:01","897-920","","6","33","","Research Policy","From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/9HBADHXY/Geels - 2004 - From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-techn.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/G8RCGD7I/S0048733304000496.html","","","Co-evolution; Institutional theory; Multi-level perspective; Regime shifts; Sectoral systems of innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases.

However, empirical evidence for these diversity effects under drought stress has remained patchy. In two pot experiments, we explored whether mixing two legume species with a contrasting response to water availability, alsike clover (AC) and black medic (BM), promotes resistance to cumulative drought stress, and resilience of aboveground crop biomass to a transient drought event. The mixture was more productive than the average of the sole crops, and this mixture effect was higher in the non-stressed than in the drought-stressed plants. However, with six levels of constant drought intensities, the mixture effect was not consistently affected by drought level. Response diversity was evident as asynchrony of growth in the two species after the drought event, with BM re-growing faster than AC. Significant resilience to drought was observed in sole AC, i.e. without response diversity. Resilience was larger in AC than in BM and increased from 44 to 72 days after sowing (DAS). The mixture was more resilient than the average resilience of the sole crops at 72 DAS, but it was never more resilient than AC, indicating that resilience is promoted by, but not dependent on response diversity. We conclude that crop diversity may contribute to drought resilience through growth asynchrony, but that species identity plays a crucial role in making systems more drought-resilient.","2020","2021-12-17 14:04:31","2021-12-17 14:04:31","2020-07-03 14:07:30","","","","11","","Front.

However, no tangible and systematic evidence exists on how this agriculture would participate in alleviating impacts on vulnerable rural communities. This paper provides a narrative systematic review (SR) integrated with a bibliometric analysis and a concept network analysis to determine how, in this changing climate, sustainable agriculture can increase the resilience of agrosystems. Our search ranged from the date of the first relevant article until the end of 2018. The results generated demonstrated the following: (a) Only single practices and methods have been studied to assess the impacts on single ecosystem services; (b) Soil quality and health are considered a key indicator of sustainable agriculture; (c) Although the assessed practices and methods were shown to improve the biodiversity of agrosystems, which makes them more resilient to extreme climate events, we are still far from developing interdisciplinary and multidimensional agriculture that integrates all management aspects and generates a full range of ecosystem services. In conclusion, this study addressed the following recommendations for the scientific community and policymakers to orient future research strategies and efforts: (a) The integration of all agrosystem services into sustainable management using an ecosystem-based approach on a life-cycle basis using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method; (b) Improving the scientific understanding of traditional knowledge to facilitate greater synergy and further integration; (c) The unification of assessment methods and indicators for the quantification of impacts; (d) The creation of a platform to share, monitor, screen, and approve assessments and evaluations of sustainable agriculture by region.","2020-01","2021-12-17 14:03:31","2021-12-17 14:03:31","2020-04-21 14:36:52","3119","","8","12","","","How Can Sustainable Agriculture Increase Climate Resilience?","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 8 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/M7HZCHGP/El Chami et al. - 2020 - How Can Sustainable Agriculture Increase Climate R.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/HECIU33S/3119.html","","","resilience; agrosystems; climate change; sustainable agriculture; systematic review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the exception of taxes on gasoline and “gas guzzlers,” a majority of respondents supported all other mitigation policies. Multivariate analyses revealed that greater trust in environmentalists and less trust in industry, greater recognition of the consequences of climate change, higher income, being black, and older age were predictive of greater policy support.

A review","Agronomy for Sustainable Development","","1773-0155","10.1051/agro/2009053","https://doi.org/10.1051/agro/2009053","During the last decade the context in which farmers must manage their farm has changed rapidly, and often with little warning. Dramatic price swings for agricultural commodities, more stringent quality requirements, new environmental regulations, the debates surrounding genetically modified crops, extreme climatic events, the demand for energy crops, the revision of the Common Agricultural Policy and the consequences of the financial crisis all create uncertainty regarding future threats and potentials. During such turbulent times, a one-sided focus on efficient production is no longer enough. Farmers also need to be able to cope with unexpected events and to adapt to new developments. Based on a literature review, we identify three strategies that strengthen the adaptive capacity of a farm: learning through experimenting and monitoring its outcomes, ensuring a flexible farm organisation to increase the options for new activities by the farm family, and diversifying to spread risks and create buffers. Implementing these strategies enlarges the farmer’s room to manoeuvre and allows identifying transition options. These options do not depend only on the farm itself, but also on the farmer’s ability to mobilise external resources and to engage in collective action. Change is then no longer seen as a disturbance, but as a trigger for the reorganisation of resources, and for the renewal of the farm organisation and activities. Implementing these strategies comes at a cost, so that farmers need to tackle the inevitable trade-offs between efficiency and adaptability. However, unless farmers master this challenge they cannot ensure the sustainability of their farms.","2010-09-01","2021-12-17 14:00:55","2021-12-17 14:00:55","2019-03-23 20:03:02","545-555","","3","30","","Agron.

Though the amount of certified organic land is increasing, the supply of organic foods lags behind demand in the United States. The reasons for this gap include a lack of government support for organics, and the peculiarities of organics as an innovation. In an attempt to close this gap, and increase the environmental sustainability of U.S. agriculture, this paper has two objectives. The first is to document the structural and institutional constraints to organic adoption. This is accomplished through a review of organic programs and policies in the U.S., in particular the National Organic Program. The second objective is to investigate the predictors of interest and the perceived barriers to organic adoption among pragmatic conventional producers in Texas, compared to organic and conventional producers. This is accomplished through a survey of a representative sample of producers in Texas. The results indicate that more than forty percent of producers who currently have conventional operations have at least some interest in organic production (pragmatic conventional producers). There are significant differences among the three groups in their structural and attitudinal characteristics related to organic adoption. For the pragmatic conventional producers, an increase in revenue would be a major facilitator of organic adoption. Their high levels of uncertainty regarding organic production and marketing, and especially organic certification constrain organic adoption. The results also reveal that the institutional setting in the U.S. hindered adoption. The paper concludes that increased institutional support would facilitate organic adoption.","2010-01","2021-12-17 13:59:49","2021-12-17 13:59:49","2019-03-06 22:13:07","163-188","","1","2","","","Overcoming the Barriers to Organic Adoption in the United States","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/SFCQWVWS/Constance and Choi - 2010 - Overcoming the Barriers to Organic Adoption in the.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/8JJ2C442/163.html","","","organic agriculture; adoption; barriers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In doing this, it offers an account of social change that centers on trust and its intersection with networks of knowledge. The argument to follow is informed by the works of Foucault and Latour but moves beyond this literature in important ways. Guided by and building upon earlier conceptual framework first forwarded by Carolan and Bell (2003, Environmental Values 12: 225–245), sustainable agriculture is examined through the lens of a “phenomenological challenge.” In doing this, analytic emphasis centers on the interpretative resources of everyday life and the artful act of practice – in other words, on “the local.” Research data involving Iowa farmers and agriculture professionals are examined to understand how social relations of trust and knowledge are contested and shaped within and between agricultural social networks and organizational configurations. All of this is meant to further our understanding of what “sustainable agriculture” is and is not, who it is, and how these boundaries change over time.","2006-10-01","2021-12-17 13:58:08","2021-12-17 13:58:08","2018-03-16 15:29:00","325-339","","3","23","","Agric Hum Values","Social change and the adoption and adaptation of knowledge claims","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/4TWGS635/Carolan - 2006 - Social change and the adoption and adaptation of k.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/67I7CBE8/s10460-006-9006-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we focus on intercropping and how this agroecological practice can be used to increase the sustainability of crop production. Strip, mixed, and relay intercropping can be used to increase crop yields through resource partitioning and facilitation. In addition to achieving greater productivity, diversifying cropping systems through the use of strategic intercrops can increase yield stability, reduce pests, and improve soil health. Several intercropping systems are already implemented in industrialized agricultural landscapes, including mixed intercropping with perennial grasses and legumes as forage and relay intercropping with winter wheat and red clover. Because intercropping can provide numerous benefits, researchers should be clear about their objectives and use appropriate methods so as to not draw spurious conclusions when studying intercrops. In order to advance the practice, experiments that test the effects of intercropping should use standardized methodology, and researchers should report a set of common criteria to facilitate cross-study comparisons. Intercropping with two or more crops appears to be less common with annuals than perennials, which is likely due to differences in the mechanisms responsible for complementarity. One area where intercropping with annuals in industrialized agricultural landscapes has advanced is with cover crops, where private, public, and governmental organizations have harmonized efforts to increase the adoption of cover crop mixtures.","2018-06-08","2021-12-17 13:57:49","2021-12-17 13:57:49","2018-09-15 17:35:13","80","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/KGYSD5SD/Bybee-Finley et al. - 2018 - Advancing Intercropping Research and Practices in .pdf","","","competition; complementarity; cover crops; crop diversity; intercropping; land equivalent ratio; multifunctionality; sustainable intensification; trade-offs; weed suppression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gillespie; Larson, Olaf F.","The Sociology of Agriculture:","","978-0-313-26444-3","","","","Published to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Rural Sociological Society, this monograph analyzes the nearly 90 years of rural sociological research on agriculture and provides a comprehensive overview of changing research focuses and theoretical approaches. As the authors note at the outset, there are a good number of continuities between early-20th-century rural sociology and what is now called the sociology of agriculture. There are also, they note, very substantial differences between contemporary sociology of agriculture scholarship and that which preceded it. Their aim throughout is to convey both continuities and discontinuities in theory, method, and approach. Intended primarily as a straightforward exposition of major scholarly themes, the volume is designed to be useful to readers from a variety of theoretical persuasions. The authors do, however, point to areas of weakness in theoretical or methodological approach that should be addressed in future research.The volume is organized around the three major eras of rural sociological conceptualizations of agriculture. The authors begin by examining the founding of U.S. rural sociology shortly after the turn of the century until the early 1950s, demonstrating that during this initial era the study of agriculture was largely construed as one of the many elements necessary for understanding the social fabric of rural community life. In the next section, they explore the social psychological/behaviorist tradition, which held sway from the early 1950s through the early 1970s and which conceptualized farmers as actors responding to stimuli such as new technologies and educational opportunities. The three chapters devoted to recent research in the emerging tradition of the new rural sociology address such topics as the political economy of agriculture, the environment of agriculture, and major theoretical trends in the sociology of agriculture. In their concluding chapter, the authors look toward the future of the sociology of agriculture and identify some potential problems as we move into the 1990s.","1990-02-08","2021-12-17 13:57:19","2021-12-17 13:57:19","","","283","","","","","The Sociology of Agriculture","","","","","Praeger","New York","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Sociology-Agriculture-Contributions/dp/0313264449","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","y First printing edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response, increasing the general adaptive capacity of farming systems is essential. We identify two divergent strategies for building adaptive capacity. Simplifying processes seek to narrowly maximize production by shifting the basis of agricultural production towards centralized control of socially and ecologically homogenized systems. Diversifying processes cultivate social-ecological complexity in order to provide multiple ecosystem services, maintain management flexibility, and promote coordinated adaptation across levels. Through five primarily United States focused cases of distinct agricultural challenges—foodborne pathogens, drought, marginal lands, labor availability, and land access and tenure—we compare simplifying and diversifying responses to assess how these pathways differentially enhance or degrade the adaptive capacity of farming systems in the context of the triple threat. These cases show that diversifying processes can weave a form of equitable and sustainable adaptive capacity that is fundamentally distinct from the narrow and brittle adaptive capacity produced through simplification. We find that while there are structural limitations and tradeoffs to diversifying processes, adaptive capacity can be facilitated by empowering people and enhancing ecosystem functionality to proactively distribute resources and knowledge where needed and to nimbly respond to changing circumstances. Our cases suggest that, in order to garner the most adaptive benefits from diversification, farming systems should balance the pursuit of multiple goals, which in turn requires an inclusive process for active dialogue and negotiation among diverse perspectives. Instead of locking farming systems into pernicious cycles that reproduce social and ecological externalities, diversification processes enable nimble responses to a broad spectrum of possible stressors and shocks, while also promoting social equity and ecological sustainability.","2021","2021-12-17 13:55:52","2021-12-17 13:55:52","2021-03-22 01:48:56","","","","5","","Front.

Although empirical evidence remains sparse, management strategies that increase environmental sustainability, such as increasing agroecosystem diversity through crop rotations, may also increase resilience to weather extremes without sacrificing yields. We used multilevel regression analyses of long-term crop yield datasets across a continental precipitation gradient to assess how temporal crop diversification affects maize yields in intensively managed grain systems. More diverse rotations increased maize yields over time and across all growing conditions (28.1% on average), including in favorable conditions (22.6%). Notably, more diverse rotations also showed positive effects on yield under unfavorable conditions, whereby yield losses were reduced by 14.0%–89.9% in drought years.

Insights into farmers’ adaptive capacity are helpful to understand how farmers perceive various options, and what they think is necessary to enable their farms to persist through uncertain times. We focus on dairy farmers, who have faced strong market volatility in the last few years. We conducted interviews with 20 dairy farmers who were starting their conversion to organic farming in Aveyron, France. The analysis showed that the interviewed farmers perceived organic farming as less risky, especially given stable prices and positive consumer perception. Also, they expected organic farming to increase their autonomy, especially regarding feed, thus reducing their farm’s exposure to volatile input prices. Interviewed farmers were aware of technical risks linked to new production practices but were confident in their ability to manage them. Organic farming was also perceived as stimulating their learning, especially through a collective dynamic and an open exchange of experiences. The interviewed farmers expected that the higher prices of organic milk would enable them to reduce the number of cows, thus reducing their workload. This would give them more time to observe, reflect, experiment, and learn, thus not only increasing their professional satisfaction but also enabling them to better cope with changes. Overall, they perceived organic farming as an attractive option to maintain the viability of their family farm, an important motivation given their rootedness in the territory. The interviews thus showed that their decision to convert to organic farming was driven by their expectation that it would enhance their adaptive capacity, thus enabling them to better face current turbulences and future changes in the broader context.","2018-07-31","2021-12-17 13:55:20","2021-12-17 13:55:20","2019-03-05 17:10:18","","","","","","Org.

It has even been shown that social networks can be more important than the existence of formal institutions for effective enforcement and compliance with environmental regulations. However, all social networks are not created equal. On the contrary, the structural pattern of relations (i.e. the topology) of a social network can have significant impact on how actors actually behave. This clearly has implications for actors’ abilities to manage environmental challenges. This review aims to add more precision to initial insights and pending hypotheses about the positive impacts of social networks on governance processes and outcomes, by reviewing and synthesizing empirically based literature explicitly studying structural characteristics of social networks in natural resource governance settings. It is shown that significant differences in governance processes and outcomes can be expected among networks experiencing structural differences in terms of density of relations, degree of cohesiveness, subgroup interconnectivity, and degree of network centralization. Furthermore, the review shows that none of these structural characteristics present a monotonically increasing positive effect on processes of importance for resource governance, and that favoring one characteristic likely occurs at the expense of another. Thus, assessing the most favorable level and mix of different network characteristics, where most of the positive governance effects are obtained while undesired effects are minimized, presents a key research and governance challenge.","2009-08-01","2021-12-17 13:54:42","2021-12-17 13:54:42","2018-09-20 04:19:20","366-374","","3","19","","Global Environmental Change","The role of social networks in natural resource governance","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/5XP6FFZY/Bodin and Crona - 2009 - The role of social networks in natural resource go.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/EIZWQCCQ/S0959378009000405.html","","","Social networks; Environmental management; Natural resource governance; Natural resource management; Network analysis; Social–ecological systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of resilience is central in this context. Resilient social-ecological systems have the potential to sustain development by responding to and shaping change in a manner that does not lead to loss of future options. Resilient systems also provide capacity for renewal and innovation in the face of rapid transformation and crisis. The term navigating in the title is meant to capture this dynamic process.

Results indicate that beliefs varied with trust, and beliefs in turn had a significant direct effect on perceived risks from climate change. Support for adaptation varied with perceived risks, while attitudes toward GHG reduction (mitigation) were associated predominantly with variation in beliefs.

In response, some governments are building new forms of public support for social-ecological services through the creation of mediated markets, such as targeted public food procurement programs. Here, we examine the relationship between farmer participation in Brazil’s National School Feeding Program and farm diversification and household autonomy, as key indicators of farm household resilience. We hypothesized that two key features of the food procurement program—structured demand for diversified food products, and a price premium for certified organic and agroecological production—would increase farm-level agrobiodiversity and the use of agroecological practices. We designed a comparative study between family farmers who do, and do not, participate in Brazil’s National School Feeding Program in the plateau region of Santa Catarina in Southern Brazil. We used semi-structured surveys to collect data on farm agrobiodiversity, management practices, and farm household autonomy, and we conducted land use history assessments. Here, we suggest for the first time that the National School Feeding Program played a role in driving the following: (1) transitions on family farms from low agrobiodiversity, input-intensive farming systems to diversified farming systems (i.e., horticultural production) and (2) a significant increase in the cropped area under diversified farming systems. This transition was supported by making horticultural production an economically viable alternative to field crops typically linked to volatile, unpredictable markets. The convergence of public policies supporting mediated markets, increased farm household autonomy, and farm diversification represents an integrated mechanism with the potential to enhance food system resilience.","2019-04-01","2021-12-17 13:46:14","2021-12-17 13:46:14","2020-12-18 15:40:59","25","","2","39","","Agron.

Among the opportunities are double-cropping and new crop options that may come with warmer temperatures and a longer frost-free period. However, prolonged periods of spring rains in recent years have delayed planting and offset the potentially beneficial longer frost-free period. Water management will be a serious challenge for Northeast farmers in the future, with projections for increased frequency of heavy rainfall events, as well as projections for more frequent summer water deficits than this historically humid region has experienced in the past. Adaptations to increase resilience to such changes include expanded irrigation capacity, modernized water monitoring and irrigation scheduling, farm drainage systems that collect excess rain into ponds for use as a water source during dry periods, and improved soil water holding capacity and drainage. Among the greatest vulnerabilities over the next several decades for the economically important perennial fruit crop industry of the region is an extended period of spring frost risk associated with warmer winter and early spring temperatures. Improved real-time frost warning systems, careful site selection for new plantings, and use of misting, wind machine, or other frost protection measures will be important adaptation strategies. Increased weed and pest pressure associated with longer growing seasons and warmer winters is another increasingly important challenge. Pro-active development of non-chemical control strategies, improved regional monitoring, and rapid-response plans for targeted control of invasive weeds and pests will be necessary.","2018-01-01","2021-12-17 13:44:11","2021-12-17 13:44:11","2019-11-20 16:01:46","231-245","","1","146","","Climatic Change","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By and large, rural producer social networks are important to the exchange of information on such complex systems and associated agrarian management practices. These information networks are not restricted to producers as other agrarian-based organizations are active within the larger agricultural innovation system. However, little is known about the effects of such organizational ties on the emergent properties of producer network structures, which play a critical role in the successful exchange of complex agrarian information and the adoption of management practices that result in higher agrodiversity. Accordingly, this study investigates information network structures within the agrarian environment in order to understand the barriers to, and development of, effective farm management, specifically the management of agrodiversity. Network data was collected from producers in two geographically separate areas in the economically important cocoa (Theobroma cacao) growing region of Ghana [Site A, located close to an urban centre, had high frequency of contact with agro-environmental organizations and Site B, in a remote location, had a low frequency of contact] on the exchange of agroforestry management practices. Results showed that although 31% of producers in Site A relied exclusively on fellow producers for agroecological information, the majority of producers formed ties to one or more of the rural organizations operating within these communities. And producers with greater access to organizations were situated in agrarian information networks with lower density, thus more diffuse networks. Furthermore, producers with ties to organizations were likely to be positioned in more efficient information networks as identified by a low level of redundant ties and this efficiency was positively correlated to higher reported on-farm agrodiversity. The success of information exchange on agro-environmental practices, such as managing agrodiversity, within producer networks may be distinctly coupled with the presence of organizational ties. Unlike common-pooled resources that may require highly dense networks for trust-based collective action, diverse agricultural systems that are innovation driven arguably require diffuse networks for efficient exchange of complex information. Policy that promotes appropriate network structures for the exchange of such information is strategic for persistent cocoa production systems. This study provides further evidence of the role of information networks on the exchange and practice of innovation in agricultural systems, particularly in developing country agriculture.","2012-06-01","2022-01-26 21:43:35","2022-01-26 21:43:55","2022-01-26 21:43:29","9-15","","","109","","Agricultural Systems","Agricultural information exchange and organizational ties","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/35J3IDTN/S0308521X12000273.html","","UNREAD","Social network analysis; Innovation; Agroforestry; Ghana; Information diffusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sustainability problems associatedwith this model have become increasinglyevident and more contested. Traditionalapproaches to promoting sustainable agriculturehave emphasized education and outreach toencourage on-farm adoption of alternativeproduction systems. Such efforts build on anunderlying assumption that farmers areempowered to make decisions regarding theorganization and management of theiroperations. However, as vertical coordinationin agriculture continues, especially in theanimal agriculture sectors, this assumptionbecomes less valid. This paper examines how thechanging industrial structure in four USlivestock sectors (poultry, hogs, beef, anddairy) affects possibilities in each forpromoting more sustainable productionpractices. Comparisons between the sectors arebased on the relative ability to employ anintensive pasture or alternative (deep-bedded)housing system, which are widely seen assustainable livestock alternatives. While thehighly integrated poultry sector appearsimpregnable to traditional sustainableagriculture approaches, the cow-calf sub-sectorof the beef industry, non-feedlot dairyoperations, and small parts of the hogindustry, especially in the Midwest, stillretain some potential for effectively targetingthe farmer. Building on the presentation ofbarriers and opportunities in the fourlivestock sectors, the paper concludes byevaluating several structurally-orientedapproaches to promoting a more sustainablelivestock agriculture that should complementmore traditional approaches.

There is renewed interest in reintegrating crops and livestock because of concerns about natural resource degradation, the profitability and stability of farm income, long-term sustainability, and increasing regulation of concentrated animal feeding operations. Integrated crop–livestock systems could foster diverse cropping systems, including the use of perennial and legume forages, which could be grown in selected areas of the landscape to achieve multiple environmental benefits. Integrated systems inherently would utilize animal manure, which enhances soil tilth, fertility, and C sequestration. Integration of crops and livestock could occur within a farm or among farms. Both scales of integration rely on farmers' knowledge, motivation, and resources. Despite the numerous benefits that could accrue if farms moved toward on-farm or among-farm integration of crops and livestock, the complexity of such systems could constrain adoption. However, farmers should expect that adoption of integrated crop–livestock systems would enhance both profitability and environmental sustainability of their farms and communities. The combination of system complexity and potential for public benefit justify the establishment of a new national or international research initiative to overcome constraints and move North American agriculture toward greater profitability and sustainability.","2007","2022-03-31 22:32:58","2022-03-31 22:32:58","2022-03-31 22:32:58","325-334","","2","99","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2134/agronj2006.0139","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/TUDIVN6U/agronj2006.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This specialization is particularly contradictory for organic operations, which aim to promote biodiversity and reduce reliance on outside sources of feed and fertility. This study investigated the challenges and opportunities experienced by farmers interested in integrating crops and livestock on organically managed farms in Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota. Qualitative methods, including focus groups and interviews, generated four categories of challenges: farming norms, complexity of management, biophysical conditions, and financial costs, and four categories of opportunities: increasing support for ICLS, financial and labor advantages, biophysical improvements, and animal welfare. Discussion of the data analysis demonstrates how most of the challenges of ICLS are mitigated by opportunities. For instance, increasing support for ICLS means there are growing communities of practice in which farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange and peer support overcome obstacles to success in these systems. Unmitigated challenges that are beyond the control of farmers include regional infrastructure, financing and insurance, and long time horizon for returns. These three unmitigated challenges may require interventions such as policy support, economic incentives and social infrastructure to enable successful farm transitions to ICLS in this region.","2018-12","2022-03-29 15:19:26","2022-03-29 15:19:26","2022-03-29 15:19:27","4606","","12","10","","","The Importance of Social Support and Communities of Practice","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 12 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/5WJHDNDI/Hayden et al. - 2018 - The Importance of Social Support and Communities o.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/NHKQCAEE/4606.html","","","organic agriculture; barriers to adoption; best management practices (BMP); closed-loop; farm transitions; integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLS); qualitative methods; small-scale farms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A study of six Australian dairy farms installing new precision dairy farming technology was undertaken to develop an in-depth picture of the issues occurring at the interface where precision farming data and decision-making meet. A qualitative exploratory case study method was used, with farmers each interviewed up to five times from pre-installation until 2years of use. A three-phase learning trajectory was observed amongst farmers involving early learning, consolidation, and advanced use. Farmers exhibited experiential learning but also learned via interaction with a network of on- and off-farm contacts forming a network of practice around the new users. This precision dairy farming network of practice formed a vital method of exchanging knowledge on how to best use technology and data in farming systems, with DSSs acting as a boundary object for learning. Externalisation of tacit knowledge into an explicit form suitable for DSSs was a major focus of this social learning. Co-construction of DSS knowledge in the emerging network was impeded by the absence of potentially important agents, in addition to the incomplete links between existing agents such as technology retailers and farmers. A technological innovation systems perspective is used to propose an improved framework to make greater use of translators and intermediaries. It is aimed at improving links amongst the community to more effectively aid farmers in creating new knowledge in agricultural DSS use.","2012-04-01","2022-03-29 00:10:03","2022-03-29 00:10:03","2022-03-29 00:10:00","10-18","","","108","","Agricultural Systems","Networks of practice for co-construction of agricultural decision support systems","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/UTZMM8DR/S0308521X11001831.html","","","Decision support systems; Innovation systems; Knowledge management; Network of practice; Precision dairy farming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Likewise, maintaining producer profitability and utilizing practices accepted by consumers and society generally must also be considered. Predicted changes in climate and water availability will likely challenge current feed and dairy production systems and their national spatial distribution, particularly the western migration of dairy production in the late 20th century. To maintain and stabilize profitability while reducing carbon footprint, particularly reductions in methane emission and enhancements in soil carbon sequestration, dairy production will need to capitalize on genetic and management innovations that enhance forage and grain production and nutritive value. Improved regional and on-farm integration of feed production and manure utilization is needed to reduce environmental nitrogen and phosphorus losses and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

Double cropping is one strategy that may help meet those goals, but in more northern latitudes traditional double cropping has been limited by a short growing season. However, since lignocellulosic biomass crops do not need to complete their lifecycle and produce seed, double cropping those species could be successful and provide several beneficial ecosystem services. This includes providing nearly year-round ground cover to reduce soil exposure to water and wind erosion, and diversifying landscapes to help mitigate the unintended consequences of many current agricultural practices. Double cropping could also offer management flexibility in response to weather and market factors, provided the net return is commensurate with current singlecrop, grain production practices.

The efficacy of agriculture systems conducive to the economic, environmental and social sustainability of farming operations has been demonstrated, yet the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices is not widespread. This qualitative study is based on a web-based survey instrument designed to elicit the barriers to adoption of sustainable agriculture practices (SAP) perceived by a positional and network sample of 269 change agents working with farmers in the US South. The analysis examines the general proposition that reluctance to change to SAP is an overused rationale of change agents that tends to mask real barriers that we endeavor to elicit in the survey. It was found that despite having support from technical assistance providers, farmers are rarely adopting SAP. Change agents often are not well prepared to attend to farmers' needs regarding SAP, particularly the needs of specific farming situations. Thus, farmers often struggle to obtain accurate information about the benefits of SAP. Government support programs often fail to encourage adoption due to lack of funding, inappropriate design and ineffective targeting of incentives. Reluctance to change is frequently mentioned by change agents, but more as a way of blaming farmers for nonadoption than explaining the often tangible reasons for their behaviors. Social barriers, land tenure, infrastructure and incompatibility are other significant impediments to adoption. Strategies such as improved management of the existing information, careful design of economic support programs and extension efforts addressed to change agents themselves could help overcome some of the barriers identified by change agents.","2009-03","2022-03-08 17:04:08","2022-03-08 17:04:08","2022-03-08 17:04:08","60-71","","1","24","","","Barriers to adoption of sustainable agriculture practices","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/AQQU354H/888E6D193CEC180F65F73C8786AA9729.html","","","adoption; barriers; change agents; sustainable agriculture practices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The combination of livestock and crops, which was very common in the past, is assumed to be a viable alternative to specialised livestock or cropping systems. Mixed crop-livestock systems can improve nutrient cycling while reducing chemical inputs and generate economies of scope at farm level. Most assumptions underlying these views are based on theoretical and experimental evidence. Very few assessments of their environmental and economic advantages have nevertheless been undertaken in real-world farming conditions. In this paper, we present a comparative assessment of the environmental and economic performances of mixed crop-livestock farms v. specialised farms among the farm population of the French ‘Coteaux de Gascogne’. In this hilly region, half of the farms currently use a mixed crop-livestock system including beef cattle and cash crops, the remaining farms being specialised in either crops or cattle. Data were collected through an exhaustive survey of farms located in our study area. The economic performances of farming systems were assessed on 48 farms on the basis of (i) overall gross margin, (ii) production costs and (iii) analysis of the sensitivity of gross margins to fluctuations in the price of inputs and outputs. The environmental dimension was analysed through (i) characterisation of farmers’ crop management practices, (ii) analysis of farm land use diversity and (iii) nitrogen farm-gate balance. Local mixed crop-livestock farms did not have significantly higher overall gross margins than specialised farms but were less sensitive than dairy and crop farms to fluctuations in the price of inputs and outputs considered. Mixed crop-livestock farms had lower costs than crop farms, while beef farms had the lowest costs as they are grass-based systems. Concerning crop management practices, our results revealed an intensification gradient from low to high input farming systems. Beyond some general trends, a wide range of management practices and levels of intensification were observed among farms with a similar production system. Mixed crop-livestock farms were very heterogeneous with respect to the use of inputs. Nevertheless, our study revealed a lower potential for nitrogen pollution in mixed crop-livestock and beef production systems than in dairy and crop farming systems. Even if a wide variability exists within system, mixed crop-livestock systems appear to be a way for an environmental and economical sustainable agriculture.","2012-10","2022-02-21 16:21:29","2022-02-21 16:21:29","2022-02-21 16:21:29","1722-1730","","10","6","","","Mixed crop-livestock systems","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/MCIMDC28/85BE7A8AAC973A6CC3CD0D075B71AF0E.html; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/857A9UWH/Ryschawy et al. - 2012 - Mixed crop-livestock systems an economic and envi.pdf","","","environment; comparative assessment; economic viability; mixed crop-livestock farming; practices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this paper is to analyse how agroecological principles can help farmers to redesign and improve the resilience, self-sufficiency, productivity, and efficiency of ICLS. Relying on case studies from Brazil and France, we examine how the transformation of two conventional, specialised systems into more integrated-production systems illustrates the different dynamics towards agroecological ICLS. The French case study, based on self-sufficient farming systems belonging to a sustainable agriculture network, highlights that cost-cutting management led to a win–win strategy comprising good economic and environmental performances. The farms decreased their dependence on external inputs and had only a limited loss of production. The past trajectories of the farms illustrate how increasing the interactions between subsystems improved the self-sufficiency and efficiency of the farms. The Brazilian case study compares slash-and-burn agriculture in the Amazonian region with the recovery of degraded grazing area by ICLS. A small increase in chemical inputs linked to a diversification of productions led to a large increase in production and a large decrease in environmental impacts (deforestation). The Brazilian case study also illustrates how the diversification of production increased the resilience of the system to market shocks. Reconstructing the links among soil, crops, and animals following agroecological principles could improve the different performances of ICLS. New agroecological ICLS, benefiting from diversified productions and increased interactions between subsystems, are likely to offset the trade-off between agricultural production and environmental impacts observed in current ICLS.","2014-07-01","2022-02-21 16:16:33","2022-02-21 16:16:33","2022-02-21 16:16:33","43-51","","","57","","European Journal of Agronomy","","Integrated crop-livestock","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/37QDETTG/S1161030113001317.html","","","Agroecology; Transition; Brazil; France; Integrated crop–livestock systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we explore the concept of diversity and its role in maximizing ecosystem services from managed grasslands and integrated agricultural systems (i.e., integrated crop–livestock–forage systems) at the field and farm level. We also examine trade-offs that may be involved in realizing greater ecosystem services. Previous research on livestock production systems, particularly in pastureland, has shown improvements in herbage productivity and reduced weed invasion with increased forage diversity but little response in terms of animal production. Managing forage diversity in pastureland requires new tools to guide the selection and placement of plant mixtures across a farm according to site suitability and the goals of the producer. Integrated agricultural systems embrace the concept of dynamic cropping systems, which incorporates a long-term strategy of annual crop sequencing that optimizes crop and soil use options to attain production, economic and resource conservation goals by using sound ecological management principles. Integrating dynamic cropping systems with livestock production increases the complexity of management, but also creates synergies among system components that may improve resilience and sustainability while fulfilling multiple ecosystem functions. Diversified conservation agricultural systems can sustain crop and livestock production and provide additional ecosystem services such as soil C storage, efficient nutrient cycling and conservation of biodiversity.","2013-06","2022-02-21 16:06:05","2022-02-21 16:06:05","2022-02-21 16:06:05","129-144","","2","28","","","Diversification and ecosystem services for conservation agriculture","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/QNVSFEDL/Sanderson et al. - 2013 - Diversification and ecosystem services for conserv.pdf; /Users/lizawood/Zotero/storage/A6J5WZY6/C29F7658818F1EC373A4F00B6E845032.html","","","crop rotations; crop sequencing; cropland; ecosystem function; integrated agricultural systems; soil biology; soil carbon management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, a diversification option that has received little attention is introduction of ley pastures into cropping systems, but the use of ley pastures is challenged by most future-oriented scenarios aiming to feed the world sustainably. In these scenarios, ruminant livestock feed only on permanent pastures, while cropping systems focus completely on production of crop-based human food. Diversification of cropping systems with ley pastures is thus compromised by knowledge gaps and future-oriented policy options. Here, we review ecosystem services provided by introducing ley pastures into cropping systems to increase sustainability of agriculture, discuss types of ley pastures and their management liable to promote these services, and raise future challenges related to introducing ley pastures into cropping systems. We conclude that (1) ley pastures provide a large set of input (soil conservation, nutrient provision and recycling, soil water retention, biological control of pests) and output (water purification, climate regulation, habitat provision for biodiversity conservation, forage production) ecosystem services of primary importance to cropping systems and society, respectively, as long as their spatial and temporal insertion within cropping systems is well-managed; otherwise, disservices may be produced. (2) To benefit from ecosystem services provided by ley pastures in cropping systems while limiting their disservices, it appears necessary to define a safe operating space for ley pastures in cropping systems. Moving towards this space requires changing plant breeding programs towards multiservice ley pastures, producing knowledge about emerging ways of introducing ley pastures into cropping systems (e.g., living mulch, green manure) and better quantifying the bundles of ecosystem services provided by ley pastures in cropping systems.","2020-05-12","2022-02-21 16:04:32","2022-02-21 16:04:32","2022-02-21 16:04:25","17","","3","40","","Agron.
