               Created in 2020 as part of our commitment to share our success with our stakeholders, the Airbnb Community Fund will distribute $100 million by the end of 2030 to strengthen communities around the world.  Celebrating its third year, the Airbnb Community Fund granted $10 million to organizations supporting communities around the world in 2023, including more than 120 nonprofits across 44 countries on six continents. Nearly $8 million was directed in partnership with our Hosts, who selected the key themes and identified organizations in the communities they call home. Airbnb Hosts are champions of the communities they call home, and we’re proud to empower them to give back to their communities through the Fund. Airbnb Hosts identified organizations working to make a difference in areas important to their communities, including environmental sustainability, economic empowerment, ending abuse and exploitation, mental health, and safe housing, among others. This year’s Community Fund grants support both larger national and regional organizations that address issues identified by our Host Advisory Board and hyperlocal, community-based organizations chosen by local Host Club members. The Airbnb Host Advisory Board, a group of 23 Hosts that represent the global Host community, selected organizations including Take 3 for the Sea in Australia, Japanese Service Dog Resource Center in Japan, Wildlife Act in South Africa, Albergo Etico in Italy, Instituto Mandaver in Brazil, the Hispanic Wealth Project in the United States, and the Georgian Bay Mnidoo Gamii Biosphere in Canada. We’re also donating to organizations across the Asia-Pacific region, including: The Great Barrier Reef Foundation in Australia to support reef conservation, biodiversity, and climate resilience as well as fostering employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; Arumjigi in Korea, a foundation to preserve the beauty of traditional culture and heritage; and  The Japan Kominka Association which revitalizes historic buildings and old vacant homes while supporting a sustainable society, among others.  Across Europe, organizations receiving grants include: HateAid in Germany to support their work promoting human rights in digital spaces and standing up against digital violence; Les Chtites Maisons Solidaires in France to help people facing homelessness; and  Apadrina un olivo in Spain to support rural communities through the conservation of olive groves, among others. Grants directed to organizations across Africa include:  Wilderness Foundation Africa to foster lasting impacts through innovative and agile conservation initiatives; Digify Africa to help young people create livelihoods in Africa’s digital economy; and  Africa Ignite to support rural development and provide pathways for income generation, among others. In Latin America, organizations receiving grants include: TETO Brazil to support low-income communities by building emergency homes for families with limited income; UNESCO Mexico to continue driving sustainable development within a Biosphere Reserve, championing cultural diversity and social inclusion within the tourism sector; and WWF Colombia to continue supporting indigenous, cultural and sustainable programs, among others. Grants directed to organizations across North America include: The Florida Alliance To End Human Trafficking to educate and train businesses and individuals across Florida to spot the signs of human trafficking and prevent future exploitation;  Fondation Michaëlle Jean in Canada which supports youth-led mobilization towards inclusion and racial justice;  The Nature Conservancy to support the Build Health Cities initiative focused on city greening and resiliency efforts; and The Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs in Atlanta to support Black entrepreneurs and small business owners to innovate, grow, create jobs, and build wealth, among others. Led by volunteer Hosts, Host Clubs are local communities of Hosts who come together to connect with each other and with Airbnb. From organizations like the SF-Marin Food Bank and Good Neighbor Japan to A Rocha Kenya and Fundación Verdaderos Héroes — and from places like Mauritius to Montenegro, Seoul to Slovenia, Bulgaria to Buenos Aires, and Uttarakhand to Uruguay – Host Club leaders worked with their members to identify, nominate and vote on organizations having deep impact in their local communities. Over 50 of the most engaged Host Clubs, representing more than 40 countries, selected non-profit organizations to receive donations. Many Community Fund grant recipients shared how the donation will support their work. To date, the Airbnb Community Fund has distributed more than $25 million in grants to organizations in 60 countries, with Hosts providing guidance each year. In its inaugural year, grants were directed to organizations that helped meet the unprecedented needs brought about by the pandemic. In 2022, the Community Fund supported organizations working to protect our planet and promote environmental sustainability. Many of these organizations have shared how these donations directly impacted their work and communities. Surfrider Foundation Canada shared: “The funds were used to support urban coastline projects and strategic priorities, including monthly beach cleanups in Vancouver, plastic pollution education and awareness, as well as designing a new campaign to address cigarette butt litter.” WWF-Chile has used the grant to advance two important projects: in Valdivia, focusing on promoting sustainable urban transportation, with the goal of reducing emissions, and in Nahuelbuta, focusing on empowering community businesses for environmental conservation and Ecological restoration. Through these initiatives, Airbnb continues to invest in the communities our Hosts call home, empowering our Hosts and supporting causes that matter most to our stakeholders. We look forward to continuing this work in the years to come. To learn more about the Community Fund and the grant recipients, please visit the Airbnb Community Fund website. The 2023-24 Airbnb Community Fund grants were distributed beginning in December 2023 and will continue through February 2024. Airbnb works with grantmaking partners, including GlobalGiving and Deed, to support due diligence and payment to some of our nonprofit grantees.
